In 2154, the natural resources of the Earth have been depleted. The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines the valuable mineral unobtanium on Pandora, a moon in the Alpha
Centauri star system Pandora whose atmosphere is mostly gaseous is inhabited by the Na'vi 10-foot-tall (3.0 m) blue-skinned sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature
Pandora, genetically matched human scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars". Paraplegic Marine Jake Sully is sent to Pandora to replace his deceased identical twin,
who had signed up to be an operator. Avatar Program head Dr. Grace Augustine considers Sully inadequate but accepts him as a bodyguard.
While escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked by Pandoran wildlife and he flees into the forest, where he is rescued by female Na'vi
Neytiri. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the spiritual leader of the clan, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their
society. Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's security force, promises Jake the company will restore his legs if he provides information about the Na'vi and their gathering
place, the giant Hometree, under which is a rich deposit of unobtanium. Learning of this, Grace transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Jake and Neytiri fall in love
as Jake is initiated into the tribe. He and Neytiri choose each other as mates. When Jake attempts to disable a bulldozer which is threatening a sacred Na'vi site, Administrator
Parker Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed. Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage Pandora's biological neural network, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one
hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate.
Jake confesses that he was a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing many including Neytiri's father, the clan chief. Mo'at frees Jake
and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, airlifts Jake, Grace, and Norm to Grace's
outpost. Grace is shot during the escape. Jake regains the Na'vi's trust by connecting his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like creature feared and revered by the Na'vi. At the sacred
Tree of Souls Jake pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls but she dies. Supported by new chief Tsu'tey, Jake
unites the clan, telling them to gather all the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a strike against the Tree of Souls to demoralize the Na'vi. Jake prays to Na'vi deity Eywa via a
neural connection with the Tree of Souls. Tsu'tey and Trudy are among the battle's heavy casualties.
The Na'vi are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Quaritch, wearing an AMP suit,
escapes his crashed aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. As Quaritch prepares to slit Jake's avatar's throat,
he is killed by Neytiri who saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time. With the exceptions of Jake, Norm, and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora.
Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.
In 1994,[13] director James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for Avatar, drawing inspiration from "every single science fiction book" he had read in his childhood as well as from adventure novels
by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard.[12] In August 1996, Cameron announced that after completing Titanic, he would film Avatar, which would make use of synthetic, or computer-generated, actors
The project would cost $100 million and involve at least six actors in leading roles "who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world".[52] Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron
has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release.[14] However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he
intended to tell. He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a Bloomberg BusinessWeek cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10
million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for Avatar, which he showed to Fox executives in October 2005.[53]
In February 2006, Cameron revealed that his film Project 880 was "a retooled version of Avatar", a film that he had tried to make years earlier,[54] citing the technological advances in the creation of the computer-generated
characters Gollum, King Kong, and Davy Jones.[12] Cameron had chosen Avatar over his project Battle Angel after completing a five-day camera test in the previous year.[55]
From January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the film's aliens, the Na'vi. Their language was created by Dr. Paul Frommer, a linguist at USC.[12] The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about
1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron. The tongue's phonemes include ejective consonants (such as the "kx" in "skxawng") that are found in Amharic, and the initial "ng" that Cameron may have taken from Te Reo Māori.[17]
Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's set designers met with Jodie S. Holt, professor of plant physiology at University of California, Riverside, to learn about the methods used by botanists to study and sample plants, and to
discuss ways to explain the communication between Pandora's organisms depicted in the film.[56]
From 2005 to 2007, Cameron worked with a handful of designers, including famed fantasy illustrator Wayne Barlowe and renowned concept artist Jordu Schell, to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when
Cameron felt that 3-D brush renderings were not capturing his vision,[57] often working together in the kitchen of Cameron's Malibu home.[58] In July 2006, Cameron announced that he would film Avatar for a mid-2008 release and planned to
begin principal photography with an established cast by February 2007.[59] The following August, the visual effects studio Weta Digital signed on to help Cameron produce Avatar.[60] Stan Winston, who had collaborated with Cameron in the past,
joined Avatar to help with the film's designs.[61] Production design for the film took several years. The film had two different production designers, and two separate art departments, one of which focused on the flora and fauna of Pandora, and
another that created human machines and human factors.[62] In September 2006, Cameron was announced to be using his own Reality Camera System to film in 3-D. The system would use two high-definition cameras in a single camera body to create depth perception.[63]
While these preparations were underway, Fox kept wavering in its commitment to Avatar because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, Titanic, even though Cameron rewrote the script to combine several characters together and
offered to cut his fee in case the film flopped.[53] Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future.[53] In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron "in no uncertain terms that they were
passing on this film," so he began shopping it around to other studios and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof of concept to then chairman Dick Cook.[53] However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal.[53] In October 2006,
Fox finally agreed to commit to making Avatar after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to less than half of the film's official $237 million budget.[53] After Fox accepted Avatar, one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told
Cameron and Landau, "I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you can do this ..."[64]
Avatar is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism, and deep ecology.[67] Cameron said his inspiration was "every single science fiction book I read as a kid" and that he wanted to update the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter
series.[12] He acknowledged that Avatar shares themes with the films At Play in the Fields of the Lord, The Emerald Forest, and Princess Mononoke, which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with Dances with Wolves, where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the
culture he was initially fighting against.[68][69] He also cited Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as Princess Mononoke as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[69]
In 2012, Cameron filed a 45-page legal declaration that intended to "describe in great detail the genesis of the ideas, themes, storylines, and images that came to be Avatar."[70] In addition to historical events (such as European colonization of the Americas), his life experiences and
several of his unproduced projects, Cameron drew connections between Avatar and his previous films. He cited his script and concept art for Xenogenesis, partially produced as a short film, as being the basis for many of the ideas and visual designs in Avatar. He stated that Avatar's
"concepts of a world mind, intelligence within nature, the idea of projecting force or consciousness using an avatar, colonization of alien planets, greedy corporate interests backed up by military force, the story of a seemingly weaker group prevailing over a technologically superior force,
and the good scientist were all established and recurrent themes" from his earlier films including Aliens, The Abyss, Rambo: First Blood Part II, The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. He specifically mentioned the "water tentacle" in The Abyss as an example of an "avatar" that
"takes on the appearance of...an alien life form...in order to bridge the cultural gap and build trust."[71]
Cameron also cited a number of works by other creators as "reference points and sources of inspiration" for Avatar. These include two of his "favorite" films, 2001: A Space Odyssey, where mankind experiences an evolution after meeting alien life, and Lawrence of Arabia, where "an outsider...
encounters and immerses into a foreign culture and then ultimately joins that group to fight other outsiders." Cameron said he became familiar with the concept of a human operating a "synthetic avatar" inside another world from George Henry Smith's short story "In the Imagicon" and Arthur C.
Clarke's novel The City and the Stars. He said he learned of the term "avatar" by reading the cyberpunk novels Neuromancer by William Gibson and Islands in the Net by Bruce Sterling. The idea of a "world mind" originated in the novel Solaris by Stanislaw Lem.
Cameron mentioned several other films about people interacting with "indigenous cultures" as inspiring him, including Dances with Wolves, The Man Who Would Be King, The Mission, The Emerald Forest, Medicine Man, The Jungle Book and FernGully.
He also cited as inspiration the John Carter and Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs and other adventure stories by Rudyard Kipling and H. Rider Haggard.[71]
In a 2007 interview with Time magazine, Cameron was asked about the meaning of the term Avatar, to which he replied, "It's an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the
human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body."[11] Cameron also cited the Japanese cyberpunk manga and anime Ghost in the Shell, in terms of how
humans can remotely control, and transfer their personalities into, alien bodies.[72][73]
Principal photography for Avatar began in April 2007 in Los Angeles and Wellington. Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments.
"Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at," Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film.[87] The live action was
shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace.[88] In January 2007, Fox had announced that 3-D filming for Avatar would be done at 24 frames per second
despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable.[89] According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures.[90]
Motion-capture photography lasted 31 days at the Hughes Aircraft stage in Playa Vista in Los Angeles.[55][91] Live action photography began in October 2007 at Stone Street Studios in Wellington and was scheduled to last 31 days.[92]
More than a thousand people worked on the production.[91] In preparation of the filming sequences, all of the actors underwent professional training specific to their characters such as archery, horseback riding, firearm use, and hand-to-hand combat.
They received language and dialect training in the Na'vi language created for the film.[93] Before shooting the film, Cameron also sent the cast to the Hawaiian tropical rainforests[94] to get a feel for a rainforest setting before shooting on the soundstage.[93]
During filming, Cameron made use of his virtual camera system, a new way of directing motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes
just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, "It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale."[95]
Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because there is no need for
repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly.[96] Cameron described the system as a "form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day,
you have complete control over the elements".[97]
Cameron gave fellow directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson a chance to test the new technology.[66] Spielberg said, "I like to think of it as digital makeup, not augmented animation ... Motion capture brings the director back to a kind of intimacy that
actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater."[96] Spielberg and George Lucas were also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment.[98]
To film the shots where CGI interacts with live action, a unique camera referred to as a "simulcam" was used, a merger of the 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. While filming live action in real time with the simulcam, the CGI images captured
with the virtual camera or designed from scratch, are superimposed over the live action images as in augmented reality and shown on a small monitor, making it possible for the director to instruct the actors how to relate to the virtual material in the scene.[93]
Due to Cameron's personal convictions about climate change, he allowed only plant-based (vegan) food to be served on set.[99]
The lead visual effects company was Weta Digital in Wellington, at one point employing 900 people to work on the film.[106] Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even on the other
side of the world, a new cloud computing and Digital Asset Management (DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially for Avatar, which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing.[107] To render Avatar,
Weta used a 930 m2 (10,000 sq ft) server farm making use of 4,000 Hewlett-Packard servers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage running Ubuntu Linux, Grid Engine cluster manager, and 2 of the animation
software and managers, Pixar's RenderMan and Pixar's Alfred queue management system.[108][109][110][111] The render farm occupies the 193rd to 197th spots in the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system,
called Mari, was developed by The Foundry in cooperation with Weta.[112][113] Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over a petabyte of digital storage,[114] and each minute of the final footage for Avatar occupies 17.28
gigabytes of storage.[115] It would often take the computer several hours to render a single frame of the film.[116] To help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, including Industrial
Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions.[117] Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.[118]
Avatar premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released theatrically worldwide from December 16 to 18.[157] The film was originally set for release on May 22, 2009, during filming[158] but was pushed back to allow more post-production time (the
last shots were delivered in November)[101] and give more time for theaters worldwide to install 3D projectors.[159] Cameron stated that the film's aspect ratio would be 1.78:1 for 3D screenings and that a 2.39:1 image would be extracted for 2D screenings.[160][161]
However, a 3D 2.39:1 extract was approved for use with constant-image-height screens (i.e., screens that increase in width to display 2.39:1 films).[162] During a 3D preview showing in Germany on December 16, the movie's DRM "protection" system failed, and
some copies delivered could not be watched at all in the theaters. The problems were fixed in time for the public premiere.[163] Avatar was released in a total of 3,457 theaters in the US, of which 2,032 theaters ran it in 3D. In total, 90% of all advance ticket sales for Avatar were for 3D screenings.[164]
Internationally, Avatar opened on a total of 14,604 screens in 106 territories, of which 3,671 were showing the film in 3D (producing 56% of the first weekend gross).[165][166] The film was simultaneously presented in IMAX 3D format, opening in 178
theaters in the United States on December 18. The international IMAX release included 58 theaters beginning on December 16, and 25 more theaters were to be added in the coming weeks.[167] The IMAX release was the company's widest to date, a total of 261 theaters worldwide.
The previous IMAX record opening was Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which opened in 161 IMAX theaters in the US, and about 70 international.[168] 20th Century Fox Korea adapted and later released Avatar in 4D version, which included "moving seats, smells of explosives, sprinkling water, laser lights and wind".[21]
Avatar was released internationally on more than 14,000 screens.[169] It earned $3,537,000 from midnight screenings domestically (United States and Canada), with the initial 3D release limited to 2,200 screens.[170] The film earned $26,752,099 on its opening day, and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend,
making it the second-largest December opening ever behind I Am Legend,[23][5] the largest domestic opening weekend for a film not based on a franchise (topping The Incredibles), the highest opening weekend for a film entirely in 3D (breaking Up's record),[171] the highest opening weekend for an environmentalist film
(breaking The Day After Tomorrow's record),[172] and the 40th-largest opening weekend in North America,[5] despite a blizzard that blanketed the East Coast of the United States and reportedly hurt its opening weekend results.[18][23][24] The film also set an IMAX opening weekend record, with 178 theaters generating
approximately $9.5 million, 12% of the film's $77 million (at the time) North American gross on less than 3% of the screens.[167]
International markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10 million were for Russia ($19.7 million), France ($17.4 million), the UK ($13.8 million), Germany ($13.3 million), South Korea ($11.7 million), Australia ($11.5 million), and Spain ($11.0 million).[5]
Avatar's worldwide gross was US$241.6 million after five days, the ninth largest opening-weekend gross of all time, and the largest for a non-franchise, non-sequel and original film.[173] 58 international IMAX screens generated an estimated $4.1 million during the opening weekend.[167]
Revenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 1.8% in domestic markets, marking a rare occurrence,[174] earning $75,617,183, to remain in first place at the box office[175] and recording what was then the biggest second weekend of all time.[176] The film experienced another
marginal decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 9.4% to $68,490,688 domestically, remaining in first place at the box office,[177] to set a third-weekend record.[178]
Avatar crossed the $1 billion mark on the 19th day of its international release, making it the first film to reach this mark in only 19 days.[179] It became the fifth film grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, and the only film of 2009 to do so.[180] In its fourth weekend,
Avatar continued to lead the box office
domestically, setting a new all-time fourth-weekend record of $50,306,217,[181]
Box Office Mojo estimates that after adjusting for the rise in average ticket prices, Avatar would be the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time in North America.[205] Box Office Mojo also observes that the higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings have had a significant impact on
Avatar's gross; it estimated, on April 21, 2010, that Avatar had sold approximately 75 million tickets in North American theaters, more than any other film since 1999's Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.[206] On a worldwide basis, when Avatar's gross stood at $2 billion just 35 days
into its run, The Daily Telegraph estimated its gross was surpassed by only Gone with the Wind ($3.0 billion), Titanic ($2.9 billion), and Star Wars ($2.2 billion) after adjusting for inflation to 2010 prices,[207] with Avatar ultimately winding up with $2.92 billion after subsequent re-releases.[5]
Reuters even placed it ahead of Titanic after adjusting the global total for inflation.[208] The 2015 edition of Guinness World Records lists Avatar only behind Gone with the Wind in terms of adjusted grosses worldwide.[209][210]
